This repository contains the homework assignments for CS307 Operating Systems at SabancÄ± University, covering essential aspects of managing system resources such as the CPU, memory, and peripheral devices. It explores the design of operating systems to efficiently and securely handle concurrent processes and threads, ensure mutual exclusion, facilitate process communication, avoid deadlocks using synchronization mechanisms, implement scheduling, and employ protection mechanisms. This repository contains all the assignments I've completed as part of the coursework which required us to apply these concepts in practical scenarios.
